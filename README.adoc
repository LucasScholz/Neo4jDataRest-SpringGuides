This guide walks you through the process of creating an application that accesses graph-based data through a link:/guides/gs/rest-hateoas[hypermedia-based] link:/understanding/REST[RESTful front end].

== What you'll build

You'll build a Spring application that let's you create and retrieve `Person` objects stored in a http://www.neo4j.org/[Neo4j] link:/understanding/NoSQL[NoSQL] database using Spring Data REST. Spring Data REST takes the features of http://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas[Spring HATEOAS] and http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-neo4j[Spring Data Neo4j] and combines them together automatically.

NOTE: Spring Data REST also supports link:/guides/gs/accessing-data-rest[Spring Data JPA], link:/guides/gs/accessing-gemfire-data-rest[Spring Data Gemfire] and link:/guides/gs/accessing-mongodb-data-rest[Spring Data MongoDB] as backend data stores, but those are not part of this guide.

== What you'll need

[[initial]]
== Create a domain object

Create a new domain object to present a person.

`src/main/java/hello/Person.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Person.java[]
----

The `Person` has a first name and a last name. There is also an id object that is configured to be automatically generated so you don't have to deal with that.

== Create a Person repository

Next you need to create a simple repository.

`src/main/java/hello/PersonRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/PersonRepository.java[]
----

This repository is an interface and will allow you to perform various operations involving `Person` objects. It gets these operations by extending the http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/{spring_data_commons}/api/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.html[PagingAndSortingRepositry] interface defined in Spring Data Commons.

At runtime, Spring Data REST will create an implementation of this interface automatically. Then it will use the http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/{spring_data_rest}/api/org/springframework/data/rest/core/annotation/RepositoryRestResource.html[@RepositoryRestResource] annotation to direct Spring MVC to create RESTful endpoints at `/people`.

NOTE: `@RepositoryRestResource` is not required for a repository to be exported. It is only used to change the export details, such as using `/people` instead of the default value of `/persons`.

== Make the application executable

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional link:/understanding/WAR[WAR] file for deployment to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method. Along the way, you use Spring's support for embedding the link:/understanding/Tomcat[Tomcat] servlet container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.


`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

`@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
    
- `@Configuration` tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration` tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
- Normally you would add `@EnableWebMvc` for a Spring MVC app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it sees **spring-webmvc** on the classpath. This flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such as setting up a `DispatcherServlet`.
- `@ComponentScan` tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the the `hello` package, allowing it to find the `HelloController`.

The `main()` method uses Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch an application. Did you notice that there wasn't a single line of XML? No **web.xml** file either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you didn't have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.

The `@EnableNeo4jRepositories` annotation activates Spring Data Neo4j. Spring Data Neo4j will create a concrete implementation of the `PersonRepository` and configure it to talk to an embedded Neo4j database using the Cypher query language. Currently you have to provide the mandatory base-package of your entities via a +setBasePackage("hello")+ method call in the configuration constructor.

Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.


== Test the application

Now that the application is running, you can test it. You can use any REST client you wish. The following examples use the *nix tool `curl`.

First you want to see the top level service.

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080
{
  "_links" : {
    "people" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  }
}
```

Here you get a first glimpse of what this server has to offer. There is a **people** link located at http://localhost:8080/people. It has some options such as `?page`, `?size`, and `?sort`.

NOTE: Spring Data REST uses the http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL format] for JSON output. It is flexible and offers a convenient way to supply links adjacent to the data that is served.

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 0,
    "totalPages" : 0,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
```

There are currently no elements and hence no pages. Time to create a new `Person`!

```
$ curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{  "firstName" : "Frodo",  "lastName" : "Baggins" }' http://localhost:8080/people
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Location: http://localhost:8080/people/0
Content-Length: 0
Date: Wed, 26 Feb 2014 20:26:55 GMT
```

- `-i` ensures you can see the response message including the headers. The URI of the newly created `Person` is shown
- `-X POST` signals this a POST used to create a new entry
- `-H "Content-Type:application/json"` sets the content type so the application knows the payload contains a JSON object
- `-d '{  "firstName" : "Frodo",  "lastName" : "Baggins" }'` is the data being sent

NOTE: Notice how the previous `POST` operation includes a `Location` header. This contains the URI of the newly created resource. Spring Data REST also has two methods on `RepositoryRestConfiguration.setReturnBodyOnCreate(…)` and `setReturnBodyOnCreate(…)` which you can use to configure the framework to immediately return the representation of the resource just created.

From this you can query against for all people:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  },
  "_embedded" : {
    "people" : [ {
      "firstName" : "Frodo",
      "lastName" : "Baggins",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/0"
        }
      }
    } ]
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 1,
    "totalPages" : 1,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
```

The **people** object contains a list with Frodo. Notice how it includes a **self** link. Spring Data REST also uses http://www.atteo.org/2011/12/12/Evo-Inflector.html[Evo Inflector] to pluralize the name of the entity for groupings.

You can query directly for the individual record:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/0
{
  "firstName" : "Frodo",
  "lastName" : "Baggins",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/0"
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE: This might appear to be purely web based, but behind the scenes, there is an embedded Neo4j graph database. In production, you would probably connect to a stand alone Neo4j server.

In this guide, there is only one domain object. With a more complex system where domain objects are related to each other, Spring Data REST will render additional links to help navigate to connected records.

You can search records by last name.

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/search/findByLastName?name=Baggins
{
  "_embedded" : {
    "people" : [ {
      "firstName" : "Frodo",
      "lastName" : "Baggins",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/0"
        },
        "person" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/0"
        }
      }
    } ]
  },
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/search/findByLastName?name=Baggins"
    }
  }
}
```

You can also issue PUT, PATCH, and DELETE REST calls to either replace, update, or delete existing records.

```
$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{ "firstName": "Bilbo", "lastName": "Baggins" }' http://localhost:8080/people/0
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/0
{
  "firstName" : "Bilbo",
  "lastName" : "Baggins",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/0"
    }
  }
}
```

```
$ curl -X PATCH -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{ "firstName": "Bilbo Jr." }' http://localhost:8080/people/0
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people/0
{
  "firstName" : "Bilbo Jr.",
  "lastName" : "Baggins",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people/0"
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE: PUT replaces an entire record. Fields not supplied will be replaced with null. PATCH can be used to update a subset of items.

You can delete records:

```
$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/people/0
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/people{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 0,
    "totalPages" : 0,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
```

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed an application with a link:/guides/gs/rest-hateoas[hypermedia-based] link:/understanding/REST[RESTful] front end and a Neo4j-based back end.
